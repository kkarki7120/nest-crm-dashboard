## 🧾 Introduction

NestCRM is an AI-powered Customer Relationship Management (CRM) platform tailored for businesses that want to understand and retain their customers better. By leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning, NestCRM predicts customer behavior, detects churn risks, and empowers sales and support teams with intelligent, data-driven insights.

This repository contains the **frontend code** for the NestCRM Dashboard — a modern, responsive, and customizable interface used by end-users to interact with their CRM data. It is built as a **single-tenant application**, where each client gets their own isolated environment, database, and backend infrastructure.

Each tenant accesses the application through their own subdomain: https://{tenant}.mausamcrm.site/dashboard
